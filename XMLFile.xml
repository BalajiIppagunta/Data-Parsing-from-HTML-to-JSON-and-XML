It focuses particularly on celebrity and fashion as two paradigmatic fields in which this is central. It provides students with a theoretical and historical understanding of publicity as a general field, from the emergence of the movie star and the development of magazine journalism to celebrity Twitter feeds and contemporary public relations. It will consider arguments about the 'noise' or 'clutter' of contemporary media and the increasing importance of an 'attention economy'.

We study the labyrinthine palaces of the Minoans, the frescos and houses of the island culture of ancient Thera, and the rich burials and city states of Mycenaean Greece to discover what this material evidence reveals about social and economic organisation, ritual practice and thriving trade and exchange. Students are introduced to emerging techniques in archaeological research as we consider how these methods have influenced our interpretation of Minoan and Mycenaean culture. We explore the role of later Greek mythologies and epic poems, including Homer's Iliad, in shaping our interpretation of these Aegean societies and examine the reliability of their portrayal. Contemporary evidence from Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean is examined, to understand the wider world of the Minoans and Mycenaeans, alongside the study of the great city of Troy.</synopsis><pre_requistics>NA</pre_requistics><prohibisions><prohibision>ATS2347</prohibision><prohibision>ATS3347</prohibision></prohibisions><requirements><requirement>Within semester assessment: 100%</requirement></requirements><outcomes><outcome>identify the major features of Minoan and Mycenaean societies, their interaction with each other and contemporary societies;</outcome><outcome>evaluate the methods of archaeological interpretation used to reconstruct the nature of these societies and the challenges posed in this;</outcome><outcome>critically appraise archaeological reports and interpretations;</outcome><outcome>discuss current archaeological methodologies and their application in the Aegean context;</outcome><outcome>assess how interpretation can be affected by the conditioning of the excavator/historian;</outcome><outcome>evaluate the use of textual sources and archaeological evidence to aid the reconstruction of ancient societies, focussing on the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures.</outcome></outcomes><chief_examiners><chief_examiner>Dr Jessie Birkett-Rees</chief_examiner></chief_examiners></unit><unit id='SWM5170'><title>Applied research study</title><synopsis>Unit content will be developed between the student and an appointed staff supervisor.

This unit introduces students to various professional processes and outcomes that contemporary visual artists engage and exhibit in. The workshop-driven classes incorporate theoretical and historical perspectives on these gallery-based modes. This unit introduces various steps required to make art public from: studio-based processes; the engagement of critical feedback; administrative processes associated with gallery-based exhibition; installing an artwork; and contextualising the artwork in a considered theoretical and curatorial framework. The workshop program facilitates a support structure for the development and consolidation of experimental approaches to conceptual and material outcomes of burgeoning research interests. Students are required to investigate and develop individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer review.

RtP rejects a traditional view of absolute state sovereignty, and is instead based on the idea that states are only sovereign so long as they don't perpetrate or allow extreme human rights abuses. In this unit we begin by surveying the recent history of RtP as a guiding framework in international politics, and considering some of the challenges that have arisen around its implementation. We then investigate four sets of questions related to RtP, with both theoretical and practical aspects. First, is RtP a way for powerful nations to exert control over vulnerable nations? Second, are there reasons to doubt the effectiveness of RtP in achieving its aims? Third, what implications does the emergence of RtP have for how we understand the philosophical nature of human rights? Fourth, what are RtP's implications in relation to growing refugee crises in the 21st century?.</synopsis><pre_requistics>NA</pre_requistics><prohibisions><prohibision>ATS2330</prohibision></prohibisions><requirements><requirement>Within semester assessment: 100%</requirement></requirements><outcomes><outcome>acquire a detailed understanding of the theory and practice of the RtP doctrine, and the relevance of RtP and human rights theory in the contemporary European context;</outcome><outcome>deepen their understanding of theoretical issues that arise in contemporary human rights discourse;</outcome><outcome>further develop critical reading and writing skills relevant to work in human rights theory and politics more generally;</outcome><outcome>students taking the class at 3rd year level will deepen their cross-cultural competence, by learning about the impact of R2P on a particular country in Africa or the Middle East.</outcome></outcomes><chief_examiners><chief_examiner>Dr Robert Simpson</chief_examiner></chief_examiners></unit><unit id='ATS3346'><title>Imperial Rome: Power and perversion in the age of Augustus and Nero</title><synopsis>The unit examines aspects of Roman political, social, and cultural history from the crucial period of transition from Republic to Empire (ca. 59 BCE to 138 CE).

This unit will establish a fundamental knowledge in the processes involved in developing a basic science finding through to clinical studies. The unit provides workshop-based learning in the development of discipline-specific laboratory research questions and how they are applied to broader clinical applications. The main focus of this unit is to identify how fundamental scientific questions may have multidisciplinary clinical answers.

It focuses on a number of powerful individuals, especially Julius Caesar and the emperors Augustus, Claudius, Nero, and Hadrian, as well as the court that grew up around them-rivals, wives, freed slaves, bodyguards, and the sometimes resentful members of the Roman elite. Themes include the nature of the Roman political system and the role of the emperor, the literature and material culture of the imperial state, the rise to power of the Praetorian Guard and imperial freedmen, and the realities of Roman rule in the provinces of the empire. We take as case studies the Roman provinces of Britannia and Judea, examining the events and context of the bloody revolts against Roman power-Boudicca's revolt in Britannia and the Revolt of 66 and Bar Kokhba's Revolt in Judea-and their effects on provincial life and imperial Rome.</synopsis><pre_requistics>NA</pre_requistics><prohibisions><prohibision>ATS2346</prohibision></prohibisions><requirements><requirement>Within semester assessment: 100%</requirement></requirements><outcomes><outcome>identify and understand the Roman political ideas of government and the manner in which these were used and manipulated by those seeking power;</outcome><outcome>describe the political, social, and cultural history of Roman during the period covered;</outcome><outcome>examine the evidence relating to the role of the emperor and how the manner and impact of the imperial position was shaped by the individual personality of the incumbent, and the response from across the Roman social spectrum, from aristocrats to rural poor, freed slaves, and provincial subjects;</outcome><outcome>evaluate cultural, political, military, religious, and archaeological aspects of life in the imperial provinces, especially in Britannia and Judea;</outcome><outcome>analyse and approach critically the variety of ancient (documentary, archaeological, and literary) and modern sources, in particular through the development of skills in source criticism;</outcome><outcome>collaborate and defend interpretations and arguments concerning the Roman Empire through group tutorial presentations and individual research.</outcome></outcomes><chief_examiners><chief_examiner>Dr Andrew Connor</chief_examiner></chief_examiners></unit><unit id='FIT5202'><title>Data processing for big data</title><synopsis>This unit teaches about working with different kinds of data, documents, graphs, spatial data.

In a liberal democracy like Australia, its role and function have profound implications for the conduct of politics, the nature of democracy and public policy outcomes. In this unit, the relationship between the media, politics and public policy is studied from three broad perspectives. First, the politics of the media is investigated from the perspective of liberal democratic theory in order to understand the role of news media on the policy debate. Second, the political economy of the media is investigated. Particular emphasis is on the structure and operation of media organisations and journalists and how political news is covered. Third, the unit undertakes a study of the relationship between the media and political actors. Particular emphasis is on the use of public relations and 'spin doctors' in managing the media as well as the utilisation of political advertising and strategic political communication by governments and political agents.</synopsis><pre_requistics>NA</pre_requistics><prohibisions>NA</prohibisions><requirements><requirement>Within semester assessment: 100%</requirement></requirements><outcomes><outcome>the ability to identify the relationship between the liberal democratic tradition and the mass media, and the assumptions (and tensions) that underpins this relationship;</outcome><outcome>the ability to critically analyse the relationship between political institutions and the media;</outcome><outcome>the ability to critically assess the impact of new technologies on the media and the opportunities and constraints this presents for government and public policy;</outcome><outcome>the ability to critically analyse the use and impact of media professionals on the policy debate;</outcome><outcome>the understanding of the legal and regulatory framework of the Australian media industry.</outcome></outcomes><chief_examiners><chief_examiner>Dr Zareh Ghazarian</chief_examiner></chief_examiners></unit><unit id='SON5025'><title>Sonographic vascular and postoperative imaging</title><synopsis>Sonographic scanning methods, techniques and protocols related to selected examinations of the cardiovascular system.

If it is the former, then what are the stakes for literature? Working with a range of novelists, poets, and theorists, this course will explore literature that engages with these questions of representation in the most innovative and exciting ways. Modernism has long been a term used to describe a radical international and experimental movement in the arts dating roughly form 1890 to 1940. More recently, however, modernism has undergone a reassessment and is now increasingly seen as an ongoing aesthetic response to various social, moral, technological, and political transformations. This unit will examine some of the major figures of avant-garde and 'High' modernism but it will also be attentive to examples of regional, 'middlebrow' and popular modernist literature's, as well as to modernism's afterlife in postmodern and contemporary literature. We will reflect on some of the most influential concepts in the early part of the twentieth century in relation to cultural and material upheavals, including urbanization, scientific and technological advances, conflicts about sexuality, and the women's movement. Our focus will be on the literary works from both within and outside of the English-speaking world that stand at the heart of definitions and debates about modernism.

The focus of the unit is the ethics of killing. The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. We examine questions such as: When, if ever, is killing justified? Many of us think that killing is permissible in emergency rescue situations, or in self-defence. Is it possible to explain this in a way that is consistent with our more typical attitudes to killing? What about killing non-human animals for food? Like all philosophy units, this unit will also develop critical and analytic thinking skills. These issues are linked to the situation regarding life and death in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the ethical dilemmas (such as violent crime) encountered within this context.</synopsis><pre_requistics>NA</pre_requistics><prohibisions><prohibision>ATS1371</prohibision><prohibision>ATS1834</prohibision></prohibisions><requirements><requirement>Within semester assessment: 60% + Exam: 40%</requirement></requirements><outcomes></outcomes><chief_examiners><chief_examiner>Dr Thando Nkohla</chief_examiner></chief_examiners></unit><unit id='MAP5101'><title>Advanced critical care skills</title><synopsis>This unit has been created in collaboration with the Alfred ICU for students seeking credit from studies in critical care in extracorporeal support, transthoracic echocardiography, transoesophageal echocardiography, critical care ultrasound and airway, bronchoscopy and ventilation.</synopsis><pre_requistics>NA</pre_requistics><prohibisions>NA</prohibisions><requirements>NA</requirements><outcomes><outcome>Critically evaluate techniques for the measurement of circulatory variables in the critically ill.</outcome><outcome>Explain the physical and physiological principles of extracorporeal support as they relate to temporary pacing (transcutaneous, transvenous and epicardial), IABP, ECMO and renal replacement therapy; and outline the indications, contraindications and most common complications of using each technique.</outcome><outcome>Outline the principles of haemodialysis and haemofiltration and how the combination of these strategies can be used in the management of critically ill patients.</outcome><outcome>Discuss the latest techniques to optimise filter life including access, dosing, dilution strategies and anticoagulation as they relate to RRT.</outcome><outcome>Explain the different modes and configurations of ECMO used for respiratory and cardiac failure respectively and outline the optimal catheter types and positions associated with each of these configurations.</outcome><outcome>Critically evaluate the indications and contraindications to ECMO and how these relate to the timing of institution of ECMO support.   p Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE), Transoesophageal Echocardiography (TOE), Critical Care Ultrasound /p </outcome><outcome>Understand the basic physic principles applicable to ultrasound.</outcome><outcome>Understand standard TTE views and how they are acquired.</outcome><outcome>Understand advanced Doppler techniques (RVSP and cardiac output).</outcome><outcome>Be able to perform and report a level one echo with predominantly qualitative reporting of pathology in a systematic fashion.</outcome><outcome>Understand how to acquire the standard 28 ASE views in a simulated model.</outcome><outcome>Have an in-depth understanding of he 3D cardiac anatomy.</outcome><outcome>Understand the indications for TOE in ICU, cardiac surgery and cardiology practice.</outcome><outcome>Understand the different probe types, selection and their utility across different ultrasounds performed.</outcome><outcome>Understand the appropriate anatomy for the relevant ultrasound procedures.</outcome><outcome>Understand how to interpret abnormal pathology and the clinical implications.</outcome><outcome>Be able to accurately perform a complete ultrasound to evaluate for DVT screening, Vascular access, eFAST, Lung ultrasound and Pleural ultrasound.   p Airway, Bronchoscopy and Ventilation /p </outcome><outcome>Demonstrate the technical skills required for airway management of critically ill patients.</outcome><outcome>Display the teamwork and decision-making skills required for airway management of critically ill patients.</outcome><outcome>Discuss important issues in weaning from mechanical ventilation (this applies to 2015 only and will vary according to the theme of The Alfred ICU Mechancial Ventilation Conference).</outcome><outcome>Apply the interpretation of ventilator waveforms to the management of critically patients.</outcome><outcome>Describe the role of bronchoscopy in ICU, bronchoscopic anatomy and relevant equipment.</outcome><outcome>Demonstrate the practical skills required to perform bronchoscopy and bronchoscopic procedures in the management of critically ill patients.</outcome></outcomes><chief_examiners><chief_examiner>Professor Carlos Scheinkestel</chief_examiner></chief_examiners></unit><unit id='ATS3012'><title>Chinese studies advanced 6: Contemporary literature</title><synopsis>Through an investigation into the key intellectual issues of a multi-disciplinary nature in post-Mao China, this unit will introduce students to a range of literary writings by a young generation of contemporary Chinese writers.

Yet leadership is a problematic concept within liberal democracies that have traditionally set out to devolve authority and check against concentrations of power. This unit explores political leadership within liberal democracies using Australia (prime ministers) and the United States (presidents) as its primary empirical reference points. It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.</synopsis><pre_requistics>NA</pre_requistics><prohibisions><prohibision>ATS2903</prohibision></prohibisions><requirements><requirement>Within semester assessment: 70% + Exam: 30%</requirement></requirements><outcomes><outcome>discuss how liberal democracies have traditionally addressed the issue of leadership;</outcome><outcome>explain some of the influential theories of political leadership, including the application of psychology to political leadership;</outcome><outcome>evaluate debates about the role of individual political leaders and historical causation;</outcome><outcome>analyse the major forces impinging upon the practice and challenges of political leadership in the early twenty-first century;</outcome><outcome>apply theoretical understandings to a case study of political leadership;</outcome><outcome>communicate research findings orally and in writing.</outcome></outcomes><chief_examiners><chief_examiner>Associate Professor Paul Strangio</chief_examiner></chief_examiners></unit><unit id='ATS2600'><title>The Holocaust</title><synopsis>This unit examines the Holocaust and its place in the broader phenomenon of genocide and mass killing in history.

Violent conflict has been a feature of human society for millennia. Today, we are arguably living in a period unprecedented global peace, but there are still numerous countries and regions that are plagued by ongoing conflicts. These range from civil conflicts in Africa, to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, the "war on terror" in the Middle-East, and other low-intensity and unconventional conflicts throughout the world. In addition, the emergence of China as a nascent military superpower, combined with the relative decline of the United States, has raised fears of a 'hegemonic transition': a delicate period that, in previous historical periods, has often been accompanied by intense security competition and war. This course will equip Monash students with the theoretical and practical knowledge to understand these issues, which rank as being among the important problems in politics.</synopsis><pre_requistics><pre_requistic>AZA1010</pre_requistic><pre_requistic>AZA1011</pre_requistic></pre_requistics><prohibisions>NA</prohibisions><requirements><requirement>Within semester assessment: 70%</requirement><requirement>Exam: 30%</requirement></requirements><outcomes><outcome>understand concepts such as terrorism, unconventional warfare, great powers, humanitarian intervention, balance of power, nuclear deterrence, hegemonic transition, and ethnic conflict;</outcome><outcome>evaluate competing explanations for war, including realist, liberal and Leninist explanations for conflict;</outcome><outcome>display a deep historical knowledge of the evolution of great power politics throughout the history;</outcome><outcome>discuss the most important contemporary debates over security issues;</outcome><outcome>successfully undertake a variety of research and writing tasks;</outcome><outcome>demonstrate improved oral and written communication skills, particularly in relation to the analysis and explanation of ideas and the development of an argument.</outcome></outcomes><chief_examiners><chief_examiner>Mr Laurence Caromba</chief_examiner></chief_examiners></unit><unit id='CHM3911'><title>Advanced physical chemistry</title><synopsis>Physical chemistry provides insight into the fundamental reason that chemical systems and materials behave the way they do.

These developments have the potential to revolutionize how we identify genes that control both simple and complex traits. Bioinformatic analysis of genomic data will also be highly influential in shaping our view of how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and how over a longer time-scale, traits such as body size and pattern and physiological and behavioral responses can evolve, leading to the rich diversity of life forms seen today. This unit will explore the use of whole-genome techniques to examine gene regulation, identify the genes controlling both simple and complex traits, determine how individuals and populations adapt to selective pressure and piece together the evolutionary changes that have given rise to complex multicellular life. Such information will increasingly be important in the 21st century for sustainable development of human civilization in concert with a healthy planetary environment.
