This unit gives students an advanced understanding of the properties and characteristics of solids, liquids and gases from a fundamental level - utilising computation of individual atoms and bonds - right through to applied systems such as colloids and surfactants, relevant to minerals, food and formulation. The course follows a natural progression from atomic and molecular properties at a single atom or bond level through key thermodynamics to the properties of chemical systems, such as viscosity, phase behaviour and the interactions between solids and liquids. The final section deals with surfaces and colloids - key to understanding important chemical systems in Australian science and industry, due to their ubiquity in minerals processing, food and dairy industries, energy and oil, pharmaceuticals, water and waste processing.", "pre_requistics": {"pre_requistic": "CHM2922"}, "prohibisions": "NA", "requirements": {"requirement": ["Examination (2 hours): 40% (Hurdle)", "Mid-semester test, assignments and computer testing: 30%", "Laboratory work and short laboratory reports and pro forma reports: 30% (Hurdle)", "To pass this unit a student must achieve a minimum score of 50% in the laboratory practical component and a minimum of 30% for the end-of-semester exam.", "Supplementary assessment is not available for the lab practical component."]}, "outcomes": {"outcome": ["Comprehend the basic concepts of computational chemistry and become proficient in the \"hands-on\" use of specific computational chemistry software.", "Develop assessment skills of reliability and accuracy of computational chemistry methods for a chemical problem at hand.", "Become proficient in the applications of the four laws of thermodynamics.", "Learn about the connections between kinetics and thermodynamics of chemical reactions.", "Understand how chemical rate analysis is performed, and analyse the kinetics of advanced chemical processes.", "Apply key concepts related to the fundamental physical chemistry of solids, liquids and gases.", "Develop an understanding of phase diagrams and phase behaviour, and how this is related to the interactions between atoms/molecules.", "Rationalise the key processes that occur at - and differences between - interfaces between solids, liquids and gases.", "Understand the wetting of solid surfaces, how this controls colloidal systems, and how kinetics of adsorption can be analysed.", "Explore colloidal systems involving solid particles, liquid droplets and gas bubbles.", "Rationalise the molecular basis for surfactant behaviour and the uses of surfactant-based systems including liquid crystals."]}, "chief_examiners": {"chief_examiner": "Associate Professor Ekaterina Pas"}}, {"@id": "ATS2335", "title": "War and memory: Resistance, massacre and representation in second world war Italy", "synopsis": "Through seminars, workshops and fieldwork this unit will examine how conflict has been represented, remembered and memorialised.

It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership.
